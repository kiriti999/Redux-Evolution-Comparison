ðŸŽ¯ Final Recommendations
Default Choice: Redux Toolkit + useSelector hooks
Unless you have specific constraints, this combination provides the best balance of productivity, maintainability, and performance.
Migration Strategy: Start where you are, move gradually
Don't attempt to rewrite everything at once. Modern Redux patterns can coexist with legacy code during transition periods.
Performance Optimization: Measure, then optimize
Don't prematurely optimize. Use React DevTools and Redux DevTools to identify actual performance bottlenecks before implementing complex solutions.
Team Adoption: Invest in training
The best technical solution is worthless without proper team adoption. Invest in training and documentation to ensure successful implementation.
