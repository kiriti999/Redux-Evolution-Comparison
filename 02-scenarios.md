üéØ Redux Scenario-Based Recommendations
A practical guide to choosing the right Redux approach based on your project's specific needs, constraints, and goals.

üöÄ For New Projects
Recommended Approach: Redux Toolkit + useSelector
The gold standard for modern Redux development that provides the best foundation for long-term success.
Why This Approach Wins:
Modern, maintainable codebase - Built with current best practices and patterns that will stand the test of time, reducing technical debt from day one.
Excellent developer experience - Streamlined API, powerful DevTools integration, and intuitive patterns that boost productivity and reduce onboarding time.
Future-proof approach - Officially supported by the Redux team with active development and regular updates, ensuring long-term viability.
Strong TypeScript support - First-class TypeScript integration with excellent type inference, making large-scale applications more manageable.


üèÉ For Small to Medium Projects
Recommended Approach: RTK with useSelector Hooks
The sweet spot for most applications, balancing simplicity with powerful capabilities.
Why This Approach Excels:
Rapid development - Get features shipped quickly without sacrificing code quality or maintainability.
Less boilerplate - Significantly reduced code volume compared to traditional Redux patterns, letting you focus on business logic.
Better maintainability - Clear, predictable patterns that make code reviews and debugging straightforward.


üè¢ For Large Legacy Codebases
Recommended Approach: Gradual Migration Path
A strategic, low-risk approach that allows you to modernize without breaking existing functionality.
